        Testing with Playwright MCP

        Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows you to write and execute automated tests using natural language. 
        Instead of writing traditional code-based tests, you can describe your test scenarios in plain English.

        This approach makes testing more accessible to team members without deep programming knowledge while maintaining the robustness of automated testing.

        While this natural language approach offers great accessibility and maintainability, it's important to note that 
        it is significantly slower than traditional Playwright tests written in code. Consider this trade-off when choosing 
        your testing approach, especially for performance-critical test suites.
